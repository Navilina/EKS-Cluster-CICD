Set up Terraform: Installed Terraform on your local machine.

Created Terraform Configuration Files: Wrote Terraform configuration files (.tf) to define the infrastructure resources you want to create, such as the EKS cluster, IAM roles, and EC2 instances.

Initialized Terraform: Ran terraform init to initialize the Terraform project and download any necessary plugins.

Planned Infrastructure: Ran terraform plan to preview the changes that Terraform will make to your infrastructure.

Applied Changes: Ran terraform apply to apply the changes and create the EKS cluster and other resources.

Cleaned Up Resources: Ran terraform destroy to delete all the resources created by Terraform, including the EKS cluster, IAM roles, and EC2 instances.

By following these steps, you were able to provision an EKS cluster using Terraform, manage its lifecycle, and clean up the resources when they were no longer needed.
